Eloquence is a package to extend Laravel 5's base Eloquent models and functionality.

It provides a number of utilities and classes to work with Eloquent in new and useful ways, 
such as camel cased attributes (for JSON apis), count caching, uuids and more.

## Installation

Install the package via composer:

    composer require kirkbushell/eloquence:~1.3

For Laravel 4, please install the 1.1.4 release. Please note that this is no longer supported 
and won't receive any new features, only security updates.

    composer require kirkbushell/eloquence:1.1.5

## Usage

First, add the eloquence service provider to your config/app.php file:

    'Eloquence\EloquenceServiceProvider',

It's important to note that this will automatically re-bind the Model class
that Eloquent uses for many-to-many relationships. This is necessary because
when the Pivot model is instantiated, we need it to utilise the parent model's
information and traits that may be needed.

You should now be good to go with your models.

## Camel case all the things!

For those of us who prefer to work with a single coding standard right across our applications, 
using the CamelCaseModel trait will ensure that all those attributes, relationships and associated 
data from our Eloquent models persist through to our APIs in a camel-case manner. This is important 
if you are writing front-end applications, which are also using camelCase. This allows for a 
better standard across our application. To use:

    use Eloquence\Database\Traits\CamelCaseModel;

Put the above line in your models and that's it.

### Note!

Eloquence DOES NOT CHANGE how you write your schema migrations. You should still be using snake_case 
when setting up your fields and tables in your database schema migrations. This is a good thing - 
snake_case of field names is the defacto standard within the Laravel community :)


## UUIDs

Eloquence comes bundled with UUID capabilities that you can use in your models.

Simply include the UUIDModel trait:

    use Eloquence\Database\Traits\UUIDModel;

And then disable auto incrementing ids:

    public $incrementing = false;

This will turn off id auto-incrementing in your model, and instead automatically generate a UUID4 value for your id field. One 
benefit of this is that you can actually know the id of your record BEFORE it's saved!

You must ensure that your id column is setup to handle UUID values. This can be done by creating a migration with the following 
properties:

    $table->char('id', $length = 36)->index();

It's important to note that you should do your research before using UUID functionality and whether it works for you. UUID 
field searches are much slower than indexed integer fields (such as autoincrement id fields).


### Custom UUIDs

Should you need a custom UUID solution (aka, maybe you don't want to use a UUID4 id), you can simply define the value you wish on 
the id field. The UUID model trait will not set the id if it has already been defined.

## Behaviours

Eloquence comes with a system for setting up behaviours, which are really just small libraries that you can use with your Eloquent models.
The first of these is the count cache.

### Count cache

Count caching is where you cache the result of a count of a related table's records. A simple example of this is where you have a user who
has many posts. In this example, you may want to count the number of posts a user has regularly - and perhaps even order by this. In SQL,
ordering by a counted field is slow and unable to be indexed. You can get around this by caching the count of the posts the user
has created on the user's record.

To get this working, you need to do two steps:

1. Configure the count cache on the model and
2. Add the count cache observer to the model to listen for certain events

#### Configure the count cache

To setup the count cache configuration, we need to have the model implement the CountCache interface, like so:

    class Post extends Eloquent implements CountCache {
        public function countCaches() {
            return [User::class];
        }
    }

This tells the count cache manager that the Post model has a count cache on the User model. So, whenever a post is added, or modified or
deleted, the count cache observer will update the appropriate user's count cache for their posts. In this case, it would update posts_count
on the user model.

The example above uses the following conventions:

* post_count is a defined field on the User model table
* user_id is the field representing the foreign key on the post model
* id is the primary key on the user model table

These are, however - configurable:

    class Post extends Eloquent implements CountCache {
        public function countCaches() {
            return [
                'num_posts' => ['User', 'users_id', 'id']
            ];
        }
    }

This example customises the count cache field, and the related foreign key, with num_posts and users_id, respectively.

#### Setup the observer

You could do this in a service provider for your application:

    Post::observe(new Eloquence\Behaviours\CountCache\CountCacheObserver);

With that, you're all done! Whenever a user deals with their posts in any way, the observer will make sure the appropriate count cache is updated!

### Sluggable models

Slugged is another behaviour that allows for the easy addition of model slugs. To use, implement the SluggableModel trait:

    class User extends Eloquent {
        use SluggableModel;
    
        public function slugStrategy() {
            return 'username';
        }
    }

Then add the observer:

    User::observe(new Eloquence\Behaviours\Slugged\SlugObserver);

In the example above, a slug will be created based on the username field of the User model. There are two other
slugs that are supported however, as well:

* id and
* uuid

The only difference between the two above, is that if you're using uuids, the slug will be generated previous
to the save, based on the uuid field. With ids, which are generally auto-increment strategies - the slug has
to be generated after the record has been saved - which results in a secondary save call to the database.

That's it! Easy huh?
